To my family belong four people. The mother I am and of course my husband belongs to it. We have two children, a son who is six years old and a three-year-old daughter.

We live in a small house with a garden. There the children can play a bit. Our son is coming to school soon, our daughter goes to kindergarten for a while. My children are at home in the afternoon. So I only work half-day.

Actually, our grandparents also belong to our family. They do not live with us. You have a house nearby. The children often visit them
