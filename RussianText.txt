Hello! My name is Masha (Maria). I’m eighteen years old. I live in Russia. I am from the city Lipetsk. Lipetsk is situated 400 kilometers to the south from Moscow. But by Russian measures that’s not a very large distance. I finished school when I was 16 years old, although in Russia the majority of pupils graduate from school at seventeen. This is because I have my birthday in the first part of the school year. It’s in December. But I liked it to be the youngest pupil in the class. I don’t know why. At school I started learning English. Now I’ve been studying English for more than 10 years.
