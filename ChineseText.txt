Bilbao in northern Spain is the capital of Vizcaya, one of the three provinces of the Basque Country (Pais Vasco). Since its foundation, more than 700 years ago, Bilbao has been the fundamental factor in the socio-economic modernisation of Vizcaya. It is the largest and liveliest Basque city with very modern feel. It is constantly reinventing itself and boasts avant-garde projects and spectacular contemporary architecture, such as the famous and still hugely impressive Guggenheim Museum.
